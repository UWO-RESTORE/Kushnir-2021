Instructions for PHREEQC Code Creation
1. Create a folder called "System Files" in the root of where you want everything to go
Example:
V:\\System Files\\
2. Ensure this file folder has:
- minteq.v4.dat database file (you can use another phreeqc database file, but make sure the code is modified
- phreeqc_no_u_g exectutive application file

2.
- put in a #Species Name before each aqueous species logK equation. 
- make sure there ARE NO SPACES AFTER THE NAME
Example:
#Pb(CO3)2-2
Pb+2 + 2CO3-2 = Pb(CO3)2-2
log_k 	9.938

3.
- put in a #Solid - solids Name before each solid species logK equation. 
- make sure there are No Spaces after the name
Example:
#Solid - Cerrusite
Cerrusite
PbCO3 = Pb+2 + CO3-2
log_k 	-13.13

4.
- put title and date as tabbed items. 
Example: 
TITLE 	Sensitivity Tests on LogKs of Pb 	May 27, 2015

5.
- ensure selected output is set, with a tab. 
Example:
SELECTED_OUTPUT
-file 	Test.txt

6.
- ensure high precision is set as "true". 
Example:
-high_precision true

7.
- ensure #Condition is set before each solution/equilibirum phase. 
- ensure there is a tab between everything
- ensure there are no spaces after pH 8 (1 space between) or DIC 0 (but there is a tab there)
Example:
#Condition	1	pH 8	DIC 0
SOLUTION 1
pH 8
pe 4        #left at default
-units mol/L
Na 0.01
C 0
N 0.01
Br 0 Charge
